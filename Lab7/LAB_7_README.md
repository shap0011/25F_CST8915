1. Understand the basic structure of a Kubernetes YAML file.
2. Learn how to create Kubernetes objects using `kubectl` and YAML files.

# Introduction

You can create Kubernetes (k8s) resources using `kubectl` or using a `YAML` file. These are two different approaches to defining and deploying resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

## `kubectl`

`kubectl` is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for Kubernetes, allowing you to interact directly with the Kubernetes API. You can use it to create, modify, and manage resources in a cluster without needing a pre-written configuration file.

Use `kubectl` commands when you:

- Are testing or experimenting with Kubernetes resources.
- Need to quickly create or modify a small number of resources.
- Don’t require version control or reproducibility.

## `YAML`

`YAML`files offer a declarative approach to defining Kubernetes resources, allowing you to specify configuration files that can be reused, versioned, and easily shared. With a YAML file, you define the desired state of the resource, and then apply it to the cluster.

**Use YAML files when you:**

Want **reproducibility, version control,** and **maintainability** of your resources.
Are working on **complex deployments** or **configurations**.
Need to **collaborate** with others or integrate into **CI/CD** processes.

## Step 1: Objects In Kubernetes

Read: [Objects In Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/)

## Step 2: Understanding Kubernetes YAML Files

In Kubernetes, resources are often defined and managed using YAML configuration files. YAML files enable you to declare the desired state of Kubernetes resources, such as Pods, Deployments, and Services, in a human-readable format.

Let’s explore the basic components of a Kubernetes YAML file.

### Key Components of a Kubernetes YAML File

1. `apiVersion`:

- Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API to use. The version depends on the type of resource being created.
- Example: `apiVersion: v1`

2. `kind`:

- Defines the type of Kubernetes resource you want to create, such as Pod, Deployment, or Service.
- Example: kind: Pod

3. `metadata`:

- Contains metadata information about the resource, like `name`, `namespace`, and `labels`, which help uniquely identify the resource within the cluster.
- Example:

```
metadata:
name: my-pod
labels:
app: my-app
```

4. `spec`:

- Provides the detailed specification of the resource. The content within `spec` varies depending on the resource type.
- For example, for a `Pod`, `spec` includes details about the containers, images, ports, and other configurations needed for the Pod.

### Example: Basic YAML Structure for a Pod

Here is a simple YAML configuration for creating a Pod with an NGINX container:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: my-pod
spec:
containers:

- name: my-container
  image: nginx
  ports: - containerPort: 80
```

### Explanation of the YAML Example

- `**apiVersion: v1**`: Specifies that this Pod uses version v1 of the Kubernetes API.
- `**kind: Pod**` Indicates that this file defines a Pod resource.
- metadata:
  - `**name: my-pod**`: Sets the name of the Pod to my-pod.
- `spec`:
  - `containers`: A list of containers to run inside the Pod.
    - `name: my-container`: The name of the container within the Pod.
    - `**image: nginx**`: Specifies the container image to use, in this case, nginx.
    - `**ports**`: Defines the network port that the container will expose, with `**containerPort: 80**` indicating that the container listens on port `80`.

## Applying the YAML File

To create the resource defined in a YAML file, use the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml
```

This command instructs Kubernetes to create or update the resource based on the YAML file. YAML files provide an easy way to manage configurations, making it simple to reproduce, modify, and apply resource definitions across environments.

Run the following command to delete all resources defined in the YAML file.

`kubectl delete -f <file-name>.yaml`

---

# Step 3: Create Resources Using kubectl and YAML

This section will show you how to create kubernetes resources using kubectl command and YAML file.

## Create an Azure Kubernetes Cluster:

Create an AKS cluster with one worker node for this exercise.

## Create a Pod:

- Using `kubectl`:

Run the following command to create a Pod directly

```
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --port=80
```

Run the following command to delete this Pod:

```
kubectl delete pods my-pod
```

- Using `YAML`

  - Save the following Pod YAML as `my-pod.yaml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

- Run the following command to apply the YAML file:

```
kubectl apply -f my-pod.yaml
```

- Verify Pod Creation:

```
kubectl get pods
```

- Run the following command to delete the pod:

```
kubectl delete -f my-pod.yaml
```

## Create a Deployment:

- Using kubectl:

```
kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx
```

Run the following command to delete the deployment:

```
kubectl delete deployments.apps my-deployment
```

- Using `**YAML**`

  - Create a file `**my-deployment.yaml**` with the following content:

  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-deployment
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```

- This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment resource named my-deployment using the apps/v1 API version.

- The Deployment specifies that **three replicas** of the application should be running, ensuring that three identical Pods are deployed and maintained

- Each Pod created by this Deployment will match the label `**app: nginx**`, which helps in grouping and identifying these Pods.

- The **template** section defines the configuration for each Pod, setting metadata labels and a specification that describes a single container.

- The container, named `nginx`, uses the `nginx` image and exposes port `80` within the container, allowing traffic directed to this port.

- This configuration enables Kubernetes to manage and maintain the desired state of the application, automatically handling scaling, rolling updates, and rescheduling Pods if needed.

- Run the following command to apply the YAML file:

```
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
```

- Verify Deployment and Pods:

```
kubectl get deployments
```

```
kubectl get pods
```

## Create a Service:

- Using `kubectl`:

  - Expose my-deployment as a Service with kubectl:

    ```
    kubectl expose deployment my-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
    ```

  - To delete this service:

    ```
    kubectl delete service my-deployment
    ```

- Using `YAML`

  - Create a file my-service.yaml with the following content:

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    selector:
      app: nginx
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:

    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  ```

- This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource named `my-service` using API version v1.

- The Service is of type LoadBalancer, which means it will expose the application to external traffic through a load balancer, making it accessible outside the Kubernetes cluster.

- The selector specifies `app: nginx`, so this Service will `route traffic to all Pods that have this label`, effectively balancing traffic across those Pods.

- The ports section defines that the Service will listen on port `80` (accessible to external clients) and forward this traffic to port `80` on the target Pods.

- This setup enables seamless load balancing and external access to the application running within the cluster.

- Apply the YAML:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml
  ```

- Verify the service:

  ```
  kubectl get services
  ```

  Note the `EXTERNAL-IP` assigned to the LoadBalancer Service for accessing the application externally.

- Delete the service:

  ```
  kubectl delete -f my-service.yaml
  ```

  - Delete the deployment:

  ```
  kubectl delete -f my-deployment.yaml
  ```

  - Verify that you deleted all resources created.

# Step 4: Defining Multiple Kubernetes Resources in a Single YAML File

In Kubernetes, you can define multiple resources in a single YAML file by separating each resource with `---`. This approach allows you to group related resources, such as a Deployment and its corresponding Service, into one file. By combining these resources, you can apply and manage them together with a single command, making deployment easier and keeping configurations organized.

### Example: The `algonquin-pet-store-all-in-one.yaml` File

In this file, we define Deployments and Services for the various components of the `Algonquin Pet Store` application, including RabbitMQ, Order Service, Product Service, and Store Front. Each section specifies a different resource, separated by `---` to clearly distinguish them.

Here’s a breakdown of the resources defined in the file:

### 1. RabbitMQ Deployment and Service:

- The first section creates a Deployment for RabbitMQ, defining a single replica with environment variables for user credentials.

- The Service for RabbitMQ exposes both the AMQP port (5672) for messaging and the management interface (15672) within the cluster.

### 2. Order Service Deployment and Service:

- The second section defines a Deployment for the Order Service with one replica, connecting it to RabbitMQ via an environment variable that specifies the connection string.

- The Service for Order Service exposes it on port `3000`, making it accessible within the cluster.

### 3. Product Service Deployment and Service:

- The third section defines a Deployment for the Product Service, again with one replica, exposing its API on port `3030`.

- The corresponding Service exposes this port internally within the cluster.

### 4. Store Front Deployment and Service:

- The final section defines a Deployment for the Store Front, setting up a single replica that serves as the frontend.

- The Service for the Store Front is of type `LoadBalancer`, exposing port `80` to external traffic so that users outside the cluster can access the frontend.

## Applying and Managing Combined Resources

By combining all resources into a single file, you can easily deploy the entire application stack with one command:

```
kubectl apply -f algonquin-pet-store-all-in-one.yaml
```

Similarly, to delete all resources defined in the file:

```
kubectl delete -f algonquin-pet-store-all-in-one.yaml
```

This setup allows you to deploy or manage all components of the application in a single step, simplifying the process and ensuring all parts of the application are consistently defined and deployed together.
